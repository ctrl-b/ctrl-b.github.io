# Bonjour hi,

My name is Ulises, and I’m an interaction designer living in Montreal, Canada, currently working full-time in the healthcare field. In my free time, I try to unravel my ideas/projects and all the new things that I come across.

If you want to discuss new technologies, wearables, IoT, privacy or cybersecurity topics, feel free to reach out.

## About my notes

These are about things I haven’t fully understand, ~~all~~ some might be wrong, the main idea is to put them out there and see if someone relates to them. My primary language is not english and I live in a bilingual city, that might affect the way the content is created ;)
