In my short professional career, I’ve seen and worked in multiple agile methodologies, none of them have achieved the goal of releasing fully functional products. What I’ve seen is unfinished work carry on a sprint to sprint, issues get closed with few pieces of the original functionality. And problems will be addressed in future iterations; that’s the purpose of agile, right?

I’ve also seen dev workflows tight to deliver more in less time kind of mentality –probably a future post on this. Additional to that, aesthetics and UX –commonly confused over UI. tagged as “nice to have.” What is nice to have, anyway?

## First question

Why user experience/research needs to align with all those dev methodologies?

## Reality check (cont.)

Agile methodologies are hard to sell, complicated to embrace, and most of the time, they come when morality is low within the team. In some cases, those agile methodologies end up being traditional workflows with an agile *facade*.

## Second question

Why released products feel like unfinished products?

## Reality check (cont.)

Thanks to agile, we keep iterating until the product is more or less what was initially being planned. Ask your users what they think about it. It’s worth mentioning that the majority of the projects I’ve worked on are from mid-big size companies transitioning to agile. So “unfinished” products are not equal to users finding alternatives, most of the time user don’t have the opportunity or is hard to find them. Startups are disrupting, but because of the way they operate, they follow the same pattern. They feel the need to prove value as soon as possible.

## Someone said once

> If you are going to do one thing, make it sure to do it right.

That should be the way to embrace agile. Start or revamp your product doing one thing at a time, then iterate on top of it. That means that a second functionally can be added next, and fixes/enhancements applied to the first one. Some might say that is impossible, but this is true when we build monolith products instead of taking a modular approach.

## Third question 

Dev teams tend to put all functionalities right in front of users eyeballs, why not one at a time at the right moment?

##  Last question

After all. Why we keep trying to align user experience to the agile workflow when it is clear that this last one needs to be fixed first.
