My perspective about how agile methodologies work with UX has changed. Now I see how it can be done, how UX people can be integrated into the development process, and how this role supports the work that needs to be done and how devs can help the UX work to happen.

One of the reasons it works is because there’s an entity that requires procedures to be in place and followed. It is complicated, but what I’ve seen is that it is possible. It requires a few things.

Clear rules; it works better with small teams, leadership, commitment and teamwork.

The work to align different processes will require time and a few iterations. Proactiveness from the team is also essential; this one needs to be build step by step.
